## **Application Idea**
Jotlyst is a simple, easy to use web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage to-do lists. With our lives more busy than ever, there has always been a need for a way to keep track of what we need to do. Each item in a to-do list is a task that needs to be completed, and users will be able to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks. The attributes of a task include:
- **Title**: The title of the task
- **Description**: The description of the task
- **Due Date**: The due date of the task
- **Priority**: The priority of the task
- **Completed**: Whether or not the task is completed
